# Task lifecycle with agents

This repository documents the end-to-end lifecycle of a development task,
from initial support request to final PR validation and documentation.

## Task flows

- [Pre-development flow – Task creation & alignment](flows/task-flow-pre-dev.md)
- [Post-development flow – Validation & documentation](flows/task-flow-post-dev.md)

## Why this matters

- Consistent task definitions
- Clear alignment before development
- Automated functional validation
- Living documentation
